Project Hexagon is a visionary project. We are envisioned to build a completely decentralized internet. That requires a few steps to be completed first to have a perfect prototype. We are importing the on-going projects fybrrChat and fybrrStream into this parent project. We next plan to start creating a decentralized social media to learn more about the process of building a new network.
